# About ReactFacts
This is my first project using React. It's simple and static website made from Scrimba. You visit the website through this link: [ReactFacts](https://adrienne-react-facts.netlify.app/)

## Quick Start

```
cd react-facts
npm install
npm run dev
```

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
